# Predictive Healthcare Analytics: Diabetes Risk & Strategic Insights

This project applies data analytics and predictive modeling to healthcare data to identify risk factors and predict the likelihood of diabetes. The goal is to demonstrate how data-driven insights can support preventive care and business intelligence decisions, similar to analytics roles at organizations like Molina Healthcare.

## 🧭 Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values and outliers.  
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** – Examine relationships between features.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Create derived indicators to improve model accuracy.  
4. **Modeling** – Train and evaluate Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.  
5. **Evaluation** – Measure performance using accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
6. **Business Insights** – Summarize key risk drivers and actionable findings.
